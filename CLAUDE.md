# Localness

Product name: **Localness**. This repo folder is still `coze-i18n` and will be renamed later.

Screenshot tagging plus a translation key store (Project → Page → Tag → I18nKey / LocaleValue). **Not** a headless CMS. Do not grow Schema-driven content modules in the Localess/Strapi sense.

Long-lived product memory lives in the Obsidian vault:

- `项目/Localness.md`
- `项目/Localness/方案调研.md`

Read those before non-trivial work. After product or architecture decisions, write back to the vault. Do not put internal repo names, URLs, or secrets in notes.

## Commands

Package manager: **pnpm**.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev                 # http://localhost:3000
pnpm typecheck           # verification (preferred over build)
pnpm test                # unit tests
pnpm exec prisma generate
pnpm exec prisma migrate dev
pnpm build               # ship / production only — not a verification step
```

There is no public register API. Create users with `scripts/register.ts` (prod: `register:prod`).

## Verify

After code changes, run **typecheck + unit tests**. Do **not** run `pnpm test:api` (paused — boots a full Nuxt server, too slow). Do **not** use `pnpm build` to check work (slow, not the signal we want).

Do **not** drive the browser (Playwright, CDP, Cursor browser tools) for UI checks — too slow. Leave UI to humans. After a UI change, the reply must list **short manual test points** (route, what to click, expected). A screenshot or a long checklist is not required.

## Stack

Nuxt 4 · Vue 3 · Prisma · SQLite · @nuxt/ui · Pinia · nuxt-auth-utils · Leafer (canvas)

- UI default is **dark**. Visible copy is hardcoded English for now.
- `app/` client, `server/` API, `shared/` constants and utils, `prisma/schema.prisma` schema.
- Prisma client emits to `prisma/client` (see generator in schema).
- `#server` → `server/`; `#shared/*` is shared by client and server.
- `modals/` and `slideovers/` have **no pathPrefix** — import by filename.

## Domain (locked)

- I18n keys are unique **per Project** (`projectId + key`).
- Tags that share a key share one `I18nKey` row.
- Teams own projects: joining a Team shows all of that Team's projects. Team roles: `OWNER` | `MEMBER`. Only a Team OWNER creates projects; only platform `ADMIN` creates Teams.
- One `LocaleValue` per locale: `draftText` + `publishedText`. Do **not** split Vue/React into two wide tables. Namespaces are not two real copy sets yet.
- First-ship string type is `STRING` only.
- Status: **Draft** if never published, or any locale draft ≠ published; otherwise **Published**.
- Export (xlsx / JSON) uses **published** text. JSON: `GET /api/projects/:id/translations/:locale?version=published`.
- Auto draft keys: `__draft_<fingerprint>`. Display via `formatI18nKeyDisplay` (`__draft_` + first 5 hash chars). **Always** `import { formatI18nKeyDisplay } from '#shared/utils'` — do not rely on auto-import in templates or TSX.
- No public signup. A Team invite code is **not** a registration code (see P1).

## Git file sync (`/git`)

LILT-style product folders: `<product>/source/` and `<product>/translated/`, flat `{ "id": "string" }` JSON. One Localness Project maps to one **product**. Unique `(adapter, remoteUrl, product)`. OWNER must set the HTTPS Git clone URL (`…/workspace/repo.git`) on `/git`; Bitbucket browser pages (`/src/<branch>/`) are normalized to that clone URL. There is **no** server default remote. Product options are **listed from that remote** (folders that contain `source/` or `translated/`), not a hardcoded whitelist. Load products also requires a token because it clones the remote.

Both Pull and Push are **three-step: machine filter → human confirmation → execute**. The automatic filter only ever produces a *default proposal*; the user may uncheck it or check things it filtered out. Nothing is written or committed by a `preview` call.

- **Pull** writes **draft** only (skip `__draft_*`). `preview` clones once (sparse checkout of the product folder), classifies every batch file as `new-file` / `changed-file` / `seen-file`, and stores a snapshot as `GitSyncPreview` (15 min TTL). New and changed files are proposed by default; seen files are hidden behind a toggle but can be selected. Within the selected files, later filename date (then later file) wins. Source locale files live under `source/`; other locales under `translated/` (do not hand-edit `translated/`).
- **Pull apply** re-checks the remote head with `git ls-remote` (a handshake, no clone). Same sha → reuse the snapshot filtered by the user's selection. Different sha → **409**, run a new preview. Writes run in one transaction. Only files the user **accepted** are recorded as seen, so a skipped file stays a candidate next time.
- **Push** proposes **published source strings that are new or changed** since the last successful landing (`GitSyncBase`). `preview` is pure database work — **no clone**. It returns *every* source key with the reason it is or is not proposed (`new-key` / `changed` / `unchanged` / `not-published` / `draft-key`), so an empty delta is explainable rather than a bare error. Open conflicts → **409**.
- **Push apply** re-reads `publishedText` from the database instead of trusting the snapshot; a key edited or unpublished since the preview is reported in `skipped`, never written back stale. Empty selection → 400.
- Three-way per `key + locale`: `GitSyncBase` (last successful landing), ours = platform draft, theirs = Git. `publishedText` is reference only.
- `GitSyncBinding.seenFiles` stores `{ path, sha }` (git blob sha), so a rewritten file is detected as changed rather than silently skipped. Legacy `string[]` rows are still read and count as seen. Paths are never returned to the client outside a preview.
- Dual-track credentials on `GitSyncBinding.credentialKind` (OWNER writes; GET never returns the token, only `tokenConfigured`):
  - `repo_access_token` → Git HTTPS user `x-token-auth`
  - `api_token` → Git HTTPS user `x-bitbucket-api-token-auth`
  Token is the password. Those usernames are protocol sentinels, not login names. Do not use Bitbucket App Passwords.
- Team members start Pull/Push. Unconfigured MEMBER sees “Contact the project owner…”. Conflicts are cards on `/git` (Use Git / Use platform / Edit). Do **not** reuse `I18nMigrateConflict`.

APIs: `GET/PUT /api/projects/:id/git-sync`, `POST .../products` (OWNER; clone remote and list `source/`/`translated/` folders), `POST .../pull/preview`, `POST .../pull/apply`, `POST .../push/preview`, `POST .../push/apply`, `GET .../conflicts`, `POST .../conflicts/:id/resolve`. There is no one-shot pull/push endpoint — apply always takes a `previewId` plus the confirmed selection.

## Routes

| Path | Notes |
|------|--------|
| `/` | Login |
| `/dashboard` | Post-login home; no workspace bar |
| `/editor` | **ssr: false** (sider project fetch needs cookies) |
| `/translations` | Key table; can create keys with no tag |
| `/git` | Git sync; **ssr: false**; Pull/Push review panels + conflict cards |
| `/teams` | Teams; invite by existing username |

Switching project must not change the current route.

## Editor (`app/core/`)

Leafer: `groupTree` holds the image plus `groupTag`. Tags sit on top of the image. Lock disables move/resize only — it is **not** a z-index change.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `draw` (default) | Click selects; drag draws a new box (must work on a locked large tag: `select: 'tap'` + `rectThrough`) |
| `edit` | Move/resize unlocked boxes |
| `drag` | Pan the canvas; tags must not steal hits |

Persist lock on `settings.locked` through the tag update API. `FuncLockBtn` uses `tagLocked`, not Leafer `Box.locked`.

## Conventions

- Keep imports at the top of the file. No inline `import()` in function bodies unless a documented cycle requires it.
- Switches over unions/enums need a `default` `never` exhaustive check.
- Touch only files the task needs. Do not commit or push unless the user asks.
- Never write secrets, `.env` values, or internal URLs into the repo or vault.
- After UI behavior changes, list short manual test points; do not automate the browser.

## Roadmap (do not implement unless asked)

**P0 — Bidirectional Git file sync** — shipped: `/git`, dual-track tokens, three-way conflicts, preview/confirm/apply for both directions. Do not put tokens or internal remotes in docs.

**P1 — Atlassian login + Team invite codes**  
Invite codes let an **already logged-in user join a Team**. They do not create accounts. Atlassian is how people get accounts. Users with no Team may log in but see no projects.
